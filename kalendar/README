Introduction:
-------------
PHP iCalendar is a PHP-based iCal file viewer/parser to display iCals in a Web browser. 
Its based on v2.0 of the IETF spec. It displays iCal files in a nice logical, 
clean manner with day, week, month, and year navigation. It is available in 13
languages and includes support for printing, searching and RSS news feeds. 
If you need a Calendar application (for creating calendar files), please check 
the 'Supported Calendar Applications' section of the README.

Contact:
--------
E-mail the developers and others on the list at:
phpicalendar-devel@lists.sourceforge.net

Installation:
-------------
- Put PHP iCalendar into your Sites folder (or another web directory)
- PHP iCalendar works 'out of the box' but you may want to configure some things
- see section below called "Configuration". 
- Put your iCal files into the directory you specify in config.inc.php
  (default is "calendars")
- Make sure PHP is enabled (http://developer.apple.com/internet/macosx/php.html)
- Turn on Web sharing (if not already on)
- View calendars in your web browser
  If it is in your Sites folder, the URL would be:
  <http://localhost/~username/phpicalendar>

Configuration:
--------------
Starting with version 2.24, PHPicalendar uses a default settings file, which
you can overrule with your own configuration settings.

View config.inc-dist.php. The comments behind each variable definition will
tell you what each setting does. Change the values between the quotation
marks to change the setting of that variable. If there are restrictions 
as to what that variable can be set to, the comment behind will specify
them. 

IN ORDER TO USE THESE SETTINGS YOU MUST RENAME THE FILE to config.inc.php

If you have difficulty with your configuration, you can ask the 
developers and other PHP iCalendar users at the PHP iCalendar forums: 
http://phpicalendar.net/forums/

Creating calendars and events:
--------------------------------
PHP iCalendar DOES NOT create or edit calendars (or events). Instead it 
provides a way to view calendars from applications that generate valid 
IETF 2445 files (.ics). Some of the supported applications are:
	
	- Apple iCal
		- http://www.apple.com/ical/
	- Mozilla Calendar
		- http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/
	- Ximian Evolution
		- http://www.novell.com/products/evolution/
	- KOrganizer
		- http://korganizer.kde.org/
	- WinDates 5.0
		- http://www.rockinsoftware.com/windates.htm

Bugs:
-----
If you find a bug, please let us know. The easiest way for you to do this
is to visit our Bug Tracker on SourceForge. This guarantees that we both 
look at it and take time to figure out what is causing it. You can submit
bugs at the following URL:
http://phpicalendar.sourceforge.net/bugs

Requests:
---------
Got an idea? Great! Just like with Bugs, there is a Features Tracker over
on SourceForge. Please use that to sumbit feature requests. That way, you can
see what others have suggested so you don't duplicate requests, and it will give
us a chance to keep the features that haven't been implemented in one central
place that we can find later. The tracker can be found at the following URL:
