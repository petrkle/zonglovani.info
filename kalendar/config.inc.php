/* Customizing phpicalendar configuration:

phpicalendar 2.3 should work with no additional configuration. This file can be changed to customize the behavior of phpicalendar.
In version 2.3, there has been a change in the way configuration works in order to reduce the number of confusing global variables.  Unfortunately, this means that config.inc.php files from older installations will have to be translated to the new format.  The conversion is simple: use the old variable names as array keys for the $configs array below.

To change basic settings, uncomment (remove the first '#') from the desired line and adjust the value.  For setting blacklists, autmatic webcals, locked calendars, and HTTP authorized calendars modify the arrays below the basic configuration section.

The commented out lines below include alternatives to the default settings.  Additional settings that can be overridden are in default_config.php

For more info and help, go to http://phpicalendar.net or email phpicalendar@gmail.com

/*     ========= BASIC CONFIGURATION =========
       ** Server configuration **

As noted, phpicalendar should work without adjusting the default settings.  Change these if you are having problems or want to change where things are found.  For example, it is often useful to have calendar_path in a different location.

       calendar_path is a FILE path
       default_path, cookie_uri, and download_uri are a URL paths, e.g. http://www.example.com/phpicalendar; set these if you are having problems.

Note that the allow_webcals setting allows webcals to be passed as URLs.  You do NOT need to override the default setting to list specific webcals for inclusion in the SPECIAL CALENDARS section below.

The salt parameter is used to obfuscate things like webcal links that may have usernames and passwords.  This should be changed.
